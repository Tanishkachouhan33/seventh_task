Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to connect Python to a MySQL database, retrieve and manipulate data, and visualize it using Matplotlib.
The workflow includes:

Establishing a MySQL connection with Python.

Retrieving data from an SQL table and converting it into a Pandas DataFrame.

Minimizing the dataset from 35 rows to a smaller subset for analysis.

Creating two visualizations:

Line Graph – to show trends over time.

Column Chart – to display quantities across categories.

Technologies Used

Python 3

MySQL

Pandas

Matplotlib

Steps Performed

Connected to MySQL using mysql.connector.

Executed SQL queries to fetch data from the book table.

Converted the result set into a Pandas DataFrame.

Reduced the DataFrame from 35 rows to a smaller sample for analysis.

Plotted a line graph and a column chart from the DataFrame.

Output Example

Line Graph – Visualizes quantity trends over a selected range.

Column Chart – Displays category-wise quantities

This project shows how Python, SQL, and Matplotlib can be integrated to create a smooth data analysis workflow — from database connection to visualization. The approach is scalable, allowing quick adjustments to datasets and chart types for deeper insights.

Do you want me to make a shorter summary version so you can directly paste it into GitHub without taking much space?
